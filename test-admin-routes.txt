Admin Routes that should work:
1. http://localhost:3000/admin - Main admin dashboard
2. http://localhost:3000/admin/upload - Content upload page
3. http://localhost:3000/dashboard/study-materials - Study materials (user dashboard)

Make sure:
- Development server is running (npm run dev)
- You are logged in first (http://localhost:3000/login)
- After login, navigate to admin routes

Steps to test:
1. Start server: npm run dev
2. Go to: http://localhost:3000
3. Click login and sign in
4. Then go to: http://localhost:3000/admin
